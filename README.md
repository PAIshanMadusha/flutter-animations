# 🎞️ Flutter Animation App

A simple and well-organized Flutter application that demonstrates various types of animations including **implicit animations**, **explicit animations**, **grid animations**, and **page transitions**. This app serves as a visual guide for beginners and intermediate developers to understand and apply Flutter animations effectively.

## ✨ Features:

### ✅ Implicit Animations:
Implicit animations are animations triggered automatically when a widget’s properties change.

- `custom_animated_box.dart`
- `custom_animated_button.dart`
- `custom_animated_container.dart`
- `custom_animated_list.dart`
- `custom_animated_opacity.dart`
- `custom_animated_padding.dart`
- `custom_animated_physical_model.dart`
- `custom_animated_positioned.dart`
- `custom_animated_switcher.dart`
- `custom_animated_text_style.dart`
- `custom_animated_theme.dart`
- `custom_animated_tween.dart`

### ✅ Explicit Animations:
Explicit animations give you more control over animations with `AnimationController`.

- `custom_loading_animation.dart`
- `custom_rotation_animation.dart`
- `custom_slide_animation.dart`
- `details_page_animation.dart`

### ✅ Grid Animations:
Animations using grid layout and animated transitions within a grid.

- `grid_home_page.dart`
- `grid_single_item_page.dart`

### ✅ Page Animations:
Smooth transitions between pages using animations.

- `first_page.dart`
- `second_page.dart`
